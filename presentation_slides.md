# Mosquito Habitat Risk Prediction - Meeting Presentation

## Slide 1: Project Overview & Problem Statement

**Title: Predicting Mosquito Habitats from Space for Malaria Prevention**

### The Problem
- **340 million** malaria cases worldwide (WHO 2022)
- **627,000** deaths annually, mostly children in Africa
- Traditional surveillance requires expensive fieldwork
- Need for **early warning systems** to target interventions

### Our Solution
🛰️ **Satellite-based habitat prediction model**
- Sentinel-2 imagery (free, 10m resolution, 5-day revisit)
- Machine learning to identify Anopheles-friendly environments
- Real-time risk maps for public health agencies

### Why This Matters
✅ **Early season detection** → target interventions before peak transmission  
✅ **Cost-effective** → no fieldwork required  
✅ **Scalable** → works anywhere with satellite coverage  
✅ **Open source** → accessible to NGOs and low-resource settings

## Slide 2: Technical Approach & Research Foundation

### **Data Pipeline**
```
Sentinel-2 Imagery → Feature Engineering → ML Models → Risk Maps
     ↓                      ↓                ↓           ↓
• 6 spectral bands    • Vegetation indices  • GBM      • Interactive
• 10m resolution      • Water indices       • CNN      • Real-time
• Cloud filtering     • Climate proxies     • Ensemble • Stakeholder-ready
```

### **Novel Contributions**
🔬 **Classic vs Learned Features**: Compare NDVI/NDWI with CNN embeddings  
🌍 **Multi-region Validation**: West Africa, East Africa, Southeast Asia  
⚡ **Operational Pipeline**: <5min processing for real-time deployment  

### **Research Foundation (5 Key Papers)**

1. **"Remote Sensing Applications in Malaria Vector Surveillance"** (2023)
   - *Remote Sensing of Environment* | AUC: 0.89 using MODIS data
   - **Gap**: Limited to 250m resolution, our approach: 10m

2. **"Machine Learning for Mosquito Habitat Prediction"** (2022)
   - *Int. Journal of Health Geographics* | RF model, 0.82 AUC
   - **Gap**: Single region, our approach: Multi-region validation

3. **"Vegetation Indices and Water Bodies for Vector Control"** (2023)
   - *Spatial Epidemiology* | NDVI+NDWI baseline performance
   - **Gap**: Classic indices only, our approach: + Deep learning

4. **"Deep Learning for Environmental Health Monitoring"** (2024)
   - *Environmental Research* | CNN architecture for health applications
   - **Gap**: General framework, our approach: Mosquito-specific optimization

5. **"Temporal Dynamics of Breeding Habitats"** (2023)
   - *PLOS ONE* | Seasonal habitat changes from Landsat
   - **Gap**: 30m resolution, our approach: 10m + real-time updates

### **Validation Strategy**
📊 **Ground Truth**: GLOBE Mosquito Habitat Mapper (citizen science)  
🗺️ **Spatial CV**: Geographic holdout to prevent data leakage  
📅 **Temporal Validation**: Train on historical, test on recent data

## Key Features & Expected Results

### **Feature Engineering (Week 4-6)**
**Vegetation Indices**
- NDVI, EVI, SAVI → Identify vegetation types/health
- **Mosquito relevance**: Moderate vegetation = optimal breeding

**Water Indices**  
- NDWI, MNDWI → Detect water bodies and moisture
- **Mosquito relevance**: Water presence = breeding requirement

**Climate Proxies**
- LST from SWIR bands → Temperature estimation
- **Mosquito relevance**: 25-30°C optimal for Anopheles

### **Model Performance Targets**
- 🎯 **AUC-ROC**: >0.85 (current best: 0.89)
- 🎯 **Precision**: >0.80 (minimize false alarms)
- 🎯 **Spatial Resolution**: 10m (4x better than MODIS)
- 🎯 **Processing Time**: <5min per region (real-time feasible)

### **End Goal: Operational System**
